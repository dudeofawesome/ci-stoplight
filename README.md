## Set up with Travis CI and LifX

1. Go to [cloud.lifx.com](cloud.lifx.com) to get a LifX bearer token for your account.
1. Get IDs for the bulbs you want to use
    1. Make a request to the LifX API
        ```bash
        curl -X GET https://api.lifx.com/v1/lights/all -H 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE'
        ```
    1. Copy the `id` key for each bulb
1. Put the bearer token and light IDs in to your server's environment
    ```bash
    LIFX_BEARER_TOKEN=???
    LIFX_ENTITY_IDS=["???"]
    ```
1. Add a [webhook to your Travis config](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/#Configuring-webhook-notifications)
    ```yaml

      webhooks:
        urls:
